# `libtidy` Introduction

**`libtidy`** is the library version of **HTML Tidy**. In fact, **Tidy** _is_
**`libtidy`**; the console application is a very simple C application that links
against **`libtidy`**. Itâ€™s what powers **Tidy**, **mod-tidy**, and countless
other applications that perform tidying.
