# HTML Tidy

## Documentation Introduction

On this page you can refer to nearly everything you need to know about **HTML
Tidy**. If you’re on Mac OS X, Linux, or UNIX you can also use `man tidy` and
read the purpose-built documentation for the version of **Tidy** that you have
installed.

You can find a [configuration quick reference here][1] (version 4.9.28).

If you’re a developer using **TidyLib** please consult the
[API Documentation][2] (version 4.9.28) and the
[TidyLib Introduction][3] page.

And if you simply want to use **Tidy**, then please read on.
