# HTML Tidy

## Documentation Introduction

On this page you can refer to nearly everything you need to know about **HTML
Tidy**. If you’re on Mac OS X, Linux, or UNIX you can also use `man tidy` and
read the purpose-built documentation for the version of **Tidy** that you have
installed.

You can find configuration quick references [in the API and Quick Reference Page][1].

If you’re a developer using **TidyLib** please consult the 
[API and Quick Reference Page][1] here, and the [TidyLib Introduction][2] page.

And if you simply want to use **Tidy**, then please read on.
