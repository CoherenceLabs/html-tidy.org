# Software using HTML Tidy

The HTML Tidy library, **`libtidy`**, is used and incorporated into many applications and projects. It offers an
extensive API to read in and parse html from a file or buffer into a DOM like node tree, has cleaning 
and diagnostic services, ability to iterate through this node tree, interogating attributes, 
child nodes, and a pretty print output. This is a list of just a few applications and projects.

- [edbrowse][10] is a portable line editor like `ed` and a browser like `lynx`, an email
  client, and much more, and is the preferred tool of a large community of visually
  impaired developers and users. [Read more…][11]
  
- [mod_tidy][20] is a **`libtidy`** based DSO module for Apache 2.0 that parses, cleans up,
  and pretty-prints the web server (X)HTML output. [Read more…][21]

- [node-libtidy][node-libtidy] provides server-side JavaScript bindings for libtidy.
  It aims to provide not only a high-level interface to a complete tidy run,
  but also offers methods which closely model the **`libtidy`** interface.

- [tidy-test][30] is a set of sample applications that exercise various aspects of the **`libtidy`**
  API. And always looking for more `samples`. It also includes a CMake module, [FindTidy.cmake][31]
  to be able to find installed Tidy headers and library for the compile link.
  
- [Notepad++][40] is a powerful editor, and several people offer a plugin that uses **`libtidy`** 
  to do cleaning, indenting, etc. Some version incompatibilites have been noted.

There are also applications that use the tidy console executable externally to add 
html cleaning.

- [CSE HTML Validator][41] is a commercial application for web professionals, webmasters, 
  etc, anyone who wants to improve their web site, or money back. It includes an interface
  to the tidy exe.
