If the idea of tidying your documents appeals to you but the command line doesn’t, or if
you’re looking for an integrated solution that incorporates HTML Tidy, then the projects
and applications on this page may be of interest to you.

Note that items appearing here aren’t endorsements by HTACG or the HTML Tidy Project team,
but we do exercise some editorial discretion about what appears here. If you think there’s
something we’re missing that uses modern Tidy or `libtidy`, please feel free to
issue a github [pull request against this web site][1], and we will be sure to
add it. You will want to add a file to [this directory][2].
