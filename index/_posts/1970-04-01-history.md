History
=======

**HTML Tidy** was created by the [W3Câ€™s][6] own  [Dave Raggett][1] back in the
dawn of the Internet age. His original Internet page is still available and
gives a sense of the early history: [Clean up your Web pages with HTML TIDY][2].

Satisfied with his work Dave passed the torch to a dedicated group of
maintainers at [tidy.sourceforge.net][5] where the important tasks of turning
**Tidy** into a C library and keeping up with developing standards was
performed.

W3C members took a renewed interest in **Tidy** in 2011 and forked the
project to [github][7] (now redirects to new maintainers), where it featured
compatibility with HTML5 via a [key contribution][8] from one of the SourceForge
key members.

In 2015 a group of concerned developers, users, and software integrators formed
[HTACG][9] with the goal of revitalizing **Tidy**, which had fallen into a
non-maintained state. As a W3C Community Group, HTACG was deemed worthy by the
W3C, and W3C passed ownership of their project to HTACG, where it is currently
being developed and prepped for a new, stable, and modern release.

HTACG is also working diligently with the SourceForge maintainers in an effort
to harmonize **HTML Tidy** into a single, stable, solid release once again.
