# Get Software using HTML Tidy

If the idea of tidying your documents appeals to you but the command line doesn’t, or if
you’re looking for an integrated solution that incorporates HTML Tidy, then these
applications or projects may just be of interest to you. 

- [edbrowse][10] is a portable line editor like `ed` and a browser like `lynx`, an email
  client, and many more, and is the preferred tool of a large community of visually
  impaired developers and users. [Read more…][11]
  
- [mod_tidy][20] is a `libtidy`-based DSO module for Apache 2.0 that parses, cleans up,
  and pretty-prints the web server (X)HTML output. [Read more…][21]

Note that items appearing here aren’t endorsements by HTACG or the HTML Tidy Project team,
but we do exercise some editorial discretion about what appears here. If you think there’s
something we’re missing that uses modern Tidy or `libtidy`, please feel free to
issue a github [pull request against this web site][1], and we will be sure to
add it. You will want to edit [this file][2].
