# Get Tidy

You may already have **Tidy** on your computer! Many operating systems ship with
the `tidy` command pre-installed. Chances are good, though, that what you have
is so outdated that it doesn’t even recognize HTML5.

## Grab a binary

HTACG makes available binaries for several platforms available [right here][10]. If there
isn’t one for your particular operating system then let us know. In the meantime there are
a few more options.

## Build from source

Building **Tidy** from source is easier than ever thanks to the efforts of our developers
in adopting [**cmake**][11]. **Tidy**’s source code is available on its
[github repository][1].


## Install from a package manager

### Mac OS X

- [Fink][21]: coming soon.
- [Homebrew][20]: `brew install tidy-html5`
- [MacPorts][22]: coming soon.


### Windows

Coming soon!

### Linux

Coming soon!
